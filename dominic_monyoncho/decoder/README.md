#2 by 4 Binary Decoder.
=========================
##objectives
To model and simulate a 2x4 binary decoder using SystemC.
##Theory/Introduction

A decoder is a circuit that changes a code into a set of signals. It is called a decoder because
it does the reverse of encoding.
A 2 to 4 decoder consists of two inputs and four outputs, truth table and symbo
The block diagram of 2 to 4 line decoder  A and B are the two inputs
where D through D are the four outputs. Truth table explains the operations of a decoder. It
shows that each output is 1 for only a specific combination of inputs.shows the
logic circuit diagram for the 2 to 4 decoder.
