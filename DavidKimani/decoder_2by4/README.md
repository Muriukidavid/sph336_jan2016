This is a 2-by-4 decoder.
Just cd into this folder and run the command 

    make decoder


A line decoder is a device that changes the input code into a set of signals.<br>
It takes an n-digit binary number and decodes it into 2<sup>n</sup> data lines.
It does the reverse of encoding. <br>

The 2-by-4 decoder decodes 2 digit binary numbers. Only the output D0 is high when both inputs i.e A0 and A1 are zero, the output D1 is high when inputs A1 is zero and A0 is 1. Only output D2 is high when inputs A1 is 1 and A2 is zero. And only output D3 is high when both inputs are 1.
